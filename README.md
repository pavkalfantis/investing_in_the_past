# Investing in the Stock Market (The Time Traveler way)

Imagine having the power to travel back in time. The possibilities would be endless! As part of the graduate course ’Programming Tools and Technologies for Data Science’, we were lucky enough to be given the power, but for a specific reason. Try to make as much money as possible on New York’s stock exchanges! In this hypothetical scenario, we are given \\$1 on 1/1/1960 and we are asked to find the best moves (i.e. buying and selling stocks of companies listed on NYSE and NASDAQ), such that the return is a large as possible. The caveat? Each day, you are only allowed to buy one more stock of a specific company than the amount of stocks you had of that company the previous day! There are some additional constraints, such as the amount of stocks traded is capped at 10% of the number of stocks traded on every day. However, even after these constraints, the amount of (hypothetical) money that can be made is pretty large! This very fun and interesting data analysis and algorithmic problem is solved using the Python programming language. This repo contains a python notebook with the analysis and a report that presents the results.
